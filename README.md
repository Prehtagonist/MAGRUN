🚗 MAGRUN

MAGRUN is a competitive, web-based driving game built around skill progression, speed control, and escalating seismic intensity. Players navigate obstacles, increase MAG levels, and compete on a persistent leaderboard to achieve the highest score.

MAGRUN combines arcade-style gameplay with polished UI, dynamic visual feedback, and a structured progression system.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Players control a car navigating through increasingly difficult obstacles.

Progression is based on MAG Levels (MAG 1 – MAG 9).

Each MAG level increases intensity, speed, and visual escalation.

The game features crash detection, restart options, and return-to-menu controls.

A persistent leaderboard tracks top players over time.
